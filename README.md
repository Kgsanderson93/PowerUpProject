# PowerUpProject  
**CSC 422 – Intro to Machine Learning**  

## Overview  
This project compares six models for predicting regional power consumption using time series data. We anticipated that a neural network model like Prophet would perform best, but XGBoost outperformed the others in both speed and accuracy, particularly in identifying and adjusting for seasonality. Interestingly, the region analyzed showed no upward trend in power consumption over 10 years, possibly due to improvements in energy efficiency offsetting population growth.  

## Models Compared  
- XGBoost  
- Prophet  
- ARIMA  
- SARIMA  
- Random Forest  
- Linear Regression  

## Key Findings  
✅ XGBoost was the fastest and most accurate  
✅ Effective handling of seasonality  
✅ No upward trend in power consumption over 10 years
