# PowerUpProject
Project for CSC 422 Intro to machine learning


This project was for my 422 automated learning class and focused on comparing how different models handled the time series data and were able to identify seasonality and account for it. We thought a neural network model like prophet would perform best but were suprised to find that in fact xgboost performed more quickly and was better able to identify and compensate for seasonality and as such its predictions were the most accurate. We were also suprised to find that over 10 years the region we chose to analyze showed no upward trend in power consumption. We theorize that perhaps this may be due to energy efficiencies increasing and offsetting any possible increase due to population.
